1. if not do, see if substract the images with their per-pixel mean can do -- done
2. try to add more L2  -- done
3. see if image augumentation can do -- done added to enlarge the dataset
4. make lr larger and lr_factor larger
5. warm up with 0.001 for 400 iters and then use 0.1 and decay by 0.1 at 32k and 48k
6. prolong the lr with 1e-2
7. see if gluon.data.vision.cifar10() can combine with mx.io.someInterface -- done, No

8. add random gaussian noise to input images -- a tiny little improvement
9. see if use more DataLoader num_workers can do -- done, generally faster than single thread
10. if done with test.py, try to use C to generate gaussian noise or random seed -- done, no need noises any more
11. see if using optimizer in the paper can do 
12. see if initializing method have impact
